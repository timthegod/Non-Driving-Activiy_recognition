# Non-Driving-Activiy_recognition
We use a spatial and motion stream cnn with ResNet50 for modeling video information in NDAs (Non-Driving-Activities) dataset that collected ourselves. NDAs are one of driver's activity, however,  when level 3 Autonomous Vehicle is in autopilot mode, the primary task of drivers are no longer driving. But we still need to understand what the drivers are doing to know the reaction time, because if the driver needs to take control the reaction time of the period became a crucial information.
For the motion stream we use FlowNet 2.0 to generate the optical flow.
